Add a dedicated Quiz feature to the existing SAT practice website. This is separate from “Practice Now”, but the layout is identical to “Practice Now” except for the functional changes described below.


---

1. Quiz Selection & Filtering

Users can select questions by topic (single or multiple topics).

Users can choose the number of questions, maximum 200. Default max shows 30–50.

Multiple topics: questions are shuffled/remixed smoothly so the same topic does not repeat consecutively unnecessarily.

One question per view.

2. Dynamic Timer

Timer adjusts automatically based on number of questions:

Example: 27 questions → 27 min, 32 questions → 32 min, etc.


Special adjustment for Standard English Conventions :

If a high proportion of selected questions are Standard English Conventions  , slightly reduce total time proportionally.


Timer is continuous for full quiz, cannot be paused, counts down minutes:seconds.

Timer updates in real-time as question count changes before quiz starts.
