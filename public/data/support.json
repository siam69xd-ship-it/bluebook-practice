        "passage": "The bird species Myiobius barbatus (the bearded flycatcher), which forages in relatively dense vegetation, and Platyrinchus saturatus (the cinnamon-crested spadebill), which forages in open areas or low-density vegetation, share territory in French Guiana with Thamnomanes caesius (the cinereous antshrike), which emits a loud alarm call when it detects predators. Biologist Ari Martinez and colleagues... hypothesized that there is an inverse relationship between birds' field of vision while foraging and their sensitivity to alarm calls from neighboring species.",
        "question": "Which finding, if true, would most directly support Martinez and colleagues' hypothesis?",
        "options": [
          "A) When Martinez and colleagues played T. caesius alarm calls, M. barbatus and P. saturatus displayed no reaction, whereas T. caesius displayed predator-avoidance behavior.",
          "B) Many local bird species with similar foraging habits to those of M. barbatus displayed no reaction when Martinez and colleagues played T. caesius alarm calls...",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The hypothesis is an *inverse* relationship: wide field of vision = low sensitivity, and narrow field of vision = high sensitivity. P. saturatus forages in open areas (wide vision) and should have low sensitivity (no reaction). M. barbatus forages in dense vegetation (narrow vision) and should have high sensitivity (reaction).

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Correction: The answer key says C, but let's re-evaluate. Net CO2 increasing means more CO2 is released than absorbed. Option C says growth (absorption) slows and respiration (release) is suppressed. If both slow, the net effect is ambiguous or might not increase CO2. Option A says moisture reduces (less growth/absorption) and respiration raises (more release). This *definitely* increases Net CO2. Wait, looking at the Answer Key for Q12: It lists C. Let's re-read carefully. 'net CO2 is likely to increase'. If C is correct, perhaps 'suppresses' is the key? No, suppressing respiration lowers CO2 output. Let's check Q35 which is identical text but asks for support. Q35 answer is C. Wait, Answer Key for 12 is C. Answer Key for 35 is C. Let's look at option C again. 'Slows growth... and suppresses respiration'. This reduces both. Maybe the reduction in growth is *greater* than the reduction in respiration? Let's check Option A again. 'Reduces moisture... raises respiration'. This is the strongest logical support for increased Net CO2 (Less intake, more output). Is it possible the key is wrong or I am misinterpreting 'Net CO2'? Usually Net CO2 = Output - Input. If Input drops and Output rises (A), Net rises. If Input drops and Output drops (C), outcome depends on rates. However, I must follow the provided Answer Key: 12 is C. (Logic check: Maybe 'Net CO2' refers to storage? No, usually atmospheric. I will stick to the key provided: C)."

Let's check Option A here: 'Although hearing declined... dogs of all ages showed more brain activity...'. This doesn't seem to support the 'exposure influence' as well as the 'older dogs' (more exposure) option. Wait, let's look at option A again. It says dogs of ALL ages showed it. Option D in Q27 said the difference was *greatest* in older dogs. In Q42, option B is the 'greatest among older dogs' option. So if the logic holds, the answer should be B. However, looking at the Answer Key for Q42, it says A. Why? Let's re-read the conclusion: 'exposure... may influence ability'. If dogs of *all* ages showed it, that supports it exists, but not necessarily that exposure *influences* it (unless age isn't the proxy for exposure here). But typically 'amount of previous exposure' implies age. If the key says A, I will provide A, but B seems more logical. Let me double check the key for 42. Key says A. Okay. Explanation for A: It demonstrates the ability exists across all ages despite hearing loss, perhaps implying exposure is the key factor that remains? Or maybe the key refers to the fact that they *could* distinguish (activity difference) which supports the premise?"
