        "passage": "In a study by Mika R. Moran, Daniel A. Rodriguez, and colleagues, residents of Panama City, Panama, and Fortaleza, Brazil, were surveyed about parks in their cities. Of the 318 respondents from Panama City, 53.5% indicated that they use the city's parks, and of 938 respondents from Fortaleza, 35.7% indicated using city parks. Given that the percentage of Panama City respondents who reported living within a 10-minute walk of a park was much lower than that reported by Fortaleza respondents, greater proximity alone can't explain the difference in park use.",
        "question": "The text makes which point about the difference between the proportions of Panama City residents and Fortaleza residents using parks?",
        "options": [
          "A) It was much larger than the researchers conducting the study expected.",
          "B) It could be due to inaccuracies in the survey results.",
          "C) It was calculated using sources that predate the survey.",
          "D) It is caused by something other than the parks' proximity to the residents."
        ]
      },
      "solution": {
        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The text states that Panama City residents use parks more (53.5% vs 35.7%) despite having *lower* proximity (fewer live within a 10-minute walk). Therefore, proximity cannot explain the difference, meaning it must be caused by something else."

        "passage": "Like all species of baleen whales, the common minkle whale feeds on tiny creatures known as Krill... it is one of the smaller baleen whales and it is much smaller than the fin whale, which can weigh a whopping 80000 kg and consume as much as 24000 kg of krill per day.",
        "question": "Based on the text, what can most reasonably be concluded about krill consumption among common minkle and fin whales?",

          "A) Both of them can eat as much as 24000 kg of krill per day.",

          "C) The fin whale is able to eat more krill per day than the minkle whale.",

        "answer": "C",
