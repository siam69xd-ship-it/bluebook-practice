The argument claims situational factors induce contrary behavior. Kamtekar argues we expect character to be consistent. 'Not ______ helpful' should contrast with 'frequently'. Wait, 'unfailingly' implies *always*, which is even stronger than frequently. Let's re-read carefully. 'We expect a person of helpful character to be frequently helpful, not ______ helpful.' If the blank is 'sporadically' (occasionally), it contrasts with 'frequently.' Yes, we expect frequency, not sporadicity. The key says D ('unfailingly'). Let's re-evaluate. Maybe the argument is about *perfect* consistency? If we expect 'frequently', maybe we don't expect 'unfailingly' (perfectly)? Ah, the text says: 'situational factors... induce behavior contrary'. Kamtekar says this is hard to reconcile with lay conception. We expect 'frequently'. The blank is what we do *not* expect? Or is the blank completing the thought 'not [just] ____ helpful'? Let's look at the answer key for 234. It says D. 'Unfailingly'. Okay, so the sentence means: We expect them to be helpful *often* (frequently), but not *always* (unfailingly). This acknowledges that situational factors *can* interfere sometimes, which reconciles the lay view with the ethicists' claim that situation matters. We don't demand perfection (unfailing), just frequency."
