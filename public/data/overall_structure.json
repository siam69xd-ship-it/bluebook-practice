        "passage": "Horizontal gene transfer involves the exchange of genetic material between organisms not in a parent-offspring relationship. It is common among prokaryotes (single-celled organisms, such as the bacteria Carnobacterium viridans and Lactococcus lactis). The process can have the effect of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics; as such, an understanding of how to prevent horizontal gene transfer might result in the mitigation of dangerous pathogens (organisms that cause disease).",

        "passage": "Why do rusty-spotted cats purr but jaguars roar? Researchers hypothesize that this difference between the two feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone in their throats called the hyoid. Rusty-spotted cats, which are much smaller than jaguars, have a rigid hyoid that rumbles when the cat's larynx vibrates, resulting in a purr. By contrast, jaguars have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that rusty-spotted cats lack. These traits allow jaguars and most other species of big cats to produce powerful roars. The same traits may also prevent most big cats from purring.",

Most other nocturnal mammals respond to lunar intensity variations similarly to Arizona pocket mice, but Azara's night monkeys (Aotus azarae) display the opposite pattern, as their heavy reliance on visual foraging results in a different balance of reward and risk.",

After examining 154 ammonite fossils including some of P. seppenradensis from Montana and Parapuzosia leptophylla (a smaller ammonite species) from England, paleontologist Christina Ifrim, Andrew S. Gale, and colleagues concluded that P. seppenradensis may have evolved from P. leptophylla and gradually increased in size as larger ammonites were better able to escape being preyed on by mosasaurs.",

        "passage": "With its combination of country and pop influences, \"Here You Come Again\" is typical of Dolly Parton's recordings in the late 1970s and first half of the 1980s. Through songs bridging these two genres, she achieved her greatest commercial successes. A decade earlier, however, Dolly had first established herself as a songwriter steeped in the traditional folk music of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where she was born and raised. The influence of the ballads of this region can be heard in the word choice and subject matter of the lyrics to \"Jolene,\" one of her best songs from this period.",

Of the 1,121 respondents from Bogotá, 71.9% indicated that they use the city's parks, and of the 938 respondents from Fortaleza, 35.7% indicated using city parks. Given that the percentage of Bogotá respondents who reported having access to desired nonpark amenities near parks was much lower than that reported by Fortaleza respondents, the difference in park use can't be explained by Bogotá residents having more access to desired nonpark amenities near parks.",
