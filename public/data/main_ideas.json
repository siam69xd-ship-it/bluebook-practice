        "passage": "The sermon is a sound of words spoken to the ear, and prepared only for present meditation and extends no farther than the strength of memory can convey it; a book printed is a record, remaining in every man's possession, always ready to renew its acquaintance with his memory, and always ready to be produced as an authority or voucher to any reports he makes out of it, and conveys its contents for ages to come, to the eternity of mortal time, when the author is forgotten in his grave.",
        "question": "Which choice best states the main idea of the text?",
        "options": [
          "A) People are less likely to forget a message when they hear it spoken aloud than they are when they read it in print.",
          "B) Unless a spoken message is delivered by a confident orator, it may be ignored.",
          "C) Most authors have little hope of being remembered well past their lifetimes.",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The text contrasts the fleeting nature of spoken sermons, which depend on memory, with the enduring nature of printed books, which serve as permanent records that can convey contents for ages. This supports the idea that printed words have greater permanence."

        "passage": "The Far Side of the World, first published in 1984, is a novel in Patrick O'Brain's Aubrey/Maturin series... Like the rest of the books in the series, The Far Side of the World has a rather abrupt ending, but the following book, The Reverse of the Medal, picks up neatly where The Far Side of the World leaves off. Thus, the sudden ending is only an issue if one considers the books as independent texts-the Aubrey/Maturin series is best thought of as a single incredibly long work, similar to other multivolume stories, such as John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga.",
