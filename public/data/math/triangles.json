      "explanation": "The figure suggests a 30-60-90 triangle with \\( \\angle A = 60^\\circ \\). Thus, \\( \\tan A = \\tan 60^\\circ = \\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.732 \\)."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Given two sides and an angle, SAS congruence requires the angle to be included. II provides \\( AC = DF \\), making angle \\( A \\) included between \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\), so SAS holds. I only indicates triangle \\( ABC \\) is isosceles, not sufficient. III gives SSA, not a valid congruence criterion."
