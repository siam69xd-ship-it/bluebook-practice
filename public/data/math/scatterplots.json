    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "The scatterplot shows the relationship between two variables, x and y. A line of best fit is also shown. Which of the following equations is the most appropriate linear model for the data shown? (Points trend downwards from approx (0, 25) to (3, 7))",
      "options": [
        "A) y = -6 + 28x",
        "B) y = 6 - 28x",
        "C) y = 28 + 6x",
        "D) y = 28 - 6x"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The line starts at a y-intercept of approximately 28. It has a negative slope, dropping from y=25 to y=7 over 3 units of x (slope ≈ -18/3 = -6). The equation y = 28 - 6x fits this description."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What data point has an actual y-value that is 2 less than the y-value predicted by the line of best fit for the corresponding x-value?",
      "options": [
        "A) (2, 12)",
        "B) (6, 14)",
        "C) (10, 12)",
        "D) (18, 4)"
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "We are looking for a point where Actual = Predicted - 2. At x=18, the line of best fit is at y=6. The actual data point is at y=4. Since 4 = 6 - 2, this matches the condition."

      "answer": "110",
      "options": [],
      "explanation": "At x=3, the line of best fit is vertically between the points for x=1 (approx 88) and x=5 (approx 132). The midpoint is (88+132)/2 = 110. Visual inspection of the line at x=3 confirms it is at y=110."
