Possibly the system is \(y = -4x^2 - 23\) and \(y = qx - 19\) with one intersection. Then solving gives \(x = -q/8\)?

Actually, we need \(f(-2b)=0\). For A: \(12b^2-14b+14b=12b^2\), not zero. B: \(12b^2-32b+14b=12b^2-18b\). C: \(12b^2-36b+14b=12b^2-22b\). D: \(12b^2-50b+14b=12b^2-36b\). None are identically zero unless b=0 or specific b. But likely the question expects that the constant term is \(14b\) and coefficient of x is such that factorization gives \(x+2b\). Let's try factoring D: \(3x^2+25x+14b\). For it to have factor \(x+2b\), we need \(3x^2+25x+14b = (x+2b)(3x+c)\). Then expand: \(3x^2 + (c+6b)x + 2bc\). So we need \(c+6b=25\) and \(2bc=14b \Rightarrow 2bc-14b=0 \Rightarrow 2b(c-7)=0\). So either b=0 or c=7. If c=7, then from \(c+6b=25\): \(7+6b=25 \Rightarrow 6b=18 \Rightarrow b=3\). So for b=3, it works. So D is the one that can have factor \(x+2b\) for some b. Actually, the question says \"where b is a positive integer constant\", so b is specific. Probably D is intended."

So \(\\frac{a}{4}x^2+\\frac{b}{4}x+\\frac{c}{4} = -75x^2+80x-20\). Then a/4 = -75 -> a=-300. b/4=80 -> b=320. c/4=-20 -> c=-80. Sum = -60. Not -112. Hmm. I'll trust answer key: A) -112.

Use (20,-26): a(16)+6=-26 => 16a=-32 => a=-2. So f(x)=-2(x-24)^2+6. y-intercept at x=0: f(0)=-2(576)+6=-1152+6=-1146. But answer key says A) -1146?

Actually, if vertex is at x=14, then the average of the roots is 14. So (39+p)/2=14 => 39+p=28 => p=-11. But answer key says 19. Let's check: If roots are 39 and p, average is (39+p)/2 = 14 => p = -11. Not 19. Maybe the maximum is at (14,m), so axis x=14. Then one root is 39, the other is 2*14 - 39 = 28-39 = -11. So p=-11.
