Sum $1+2+10+11+20 = 44$. Mean $44/5 = 8.8$. Wait, integers don't have to be positive? 'Positive integers' usually implied. If not, can be negative. Assuming positive. Key says 20 is B? 8.2? If $x_1, x_2$ can be close to 10? No, smallest mean requires smallest numbers. Maybe not distinct? '5 distinct integers'. If negative allowed? If Key B (8.2) is correct -> Sum 41. $1+2+10+11+17=41$ (if largest 17). Largest is 20. $1+2+10+11+20 = 44$. 8.8. Let's check text for 'positive'. Snippet doesn't say.
