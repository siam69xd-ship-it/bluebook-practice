      "question": "A company conducted a study on extracurricular activities and school spirit. 90 students selected from a large school district in the US. Results showed a relationship. What prevents generalizing to all students in the US?",
      "options": ["A) Selected students are not all from same school.", "B) Number of selected students is too small.", "C) Number of selected students from each grade is different.", "D) The selected students are from only one school district."],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "The sample was drawn from a single school district. To generalize to the entire US, the sample must be representative of the US population, not just one district."

      "question": "Machine fills bags with 10 oz cranberries. 148 bags selected at random. Average weight 10.02 oz, margin of error 0.08 oz. Conclusion?",
      "options": ["A) The true mean weight of all bags is exactly 10.02 oz.", "B) It is plausible the true mean is between 9.94 and 10.10 oz.", "C) All bags weigh between 9.94 and 10.10 oz.", "D) ..."],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The confidence interval is Mean $\\pm$ Margin of Error: $10.02 \\pm 0.08 = [9.94, 10.10]$. It is plausible the population mean lies in this interval."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Interval: $15 \\pm 2 = [13, 17]$. 14 falls within this range."

      "question": "Survey of 500 voters. 52% favor Candidate A. Margin of error 4%. Is it plausible that Candidate A loses (receives < 50%)?",
      "options": ["A) Yes, because 48% is in the interval.", "B) No, because 50% is not in the interval.", "C) ...", "D) ..."],
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Interval: $52 \\pm 4 = [48, 56]$. The interval includes values less than 50% (e.g., 48%, 49%), so it is plausible they lose."

      "question": "A sample size is increased from 100 to 400. How does the margin of error change (assuming same confidence level)?",
      "options": ["A) It doubles.", "B) It is halved.", "C) It stays the same.", "D) It quadruples."],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of sample size. $\\sqrt{400} = 20$, $\\sqrt{100} = 10$. Ratio is $10/20 = 1/2$. Margin of error is halved."

      "options": ["A) Decreasing sample size", "B) Increasing sample size", "C) Increasing variability", "D) Increasing confidence level"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Larger sample sizes reduce the margin of error."

      "answer": "A",

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Confidence interval: $6.8 \\pm 1.1 = [5.7, 7.9]$. It is plausible the true mean is in this interval."
