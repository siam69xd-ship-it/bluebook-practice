      "options": ["Student Grid-In"],
      "answer": "61",
      "explanation": "Add the two equations together: $(5x + 3x) + (4y - 7y) = 44 + 17$. This simplifies to $8x - 3y = 61$."

      "question": "$2x-2y=2$\nOne of the two linear equation in a system is given. The system has exactly one solution. Which equation could be the second equation in this system?",
      "options": ["A) $-8x+8y=3$", "B) $3x-3y=8$", "C) $-10x+8y=5$", "D) $-x+y=-1$"],
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The given equation simplifies to $y = x - 1$ (slope = 1). For exactly one solution, the second line must have a different slope.\n- A: $y = x + 3/8$ (slope 1, parallel).\n- B: $y = x - 8/3$ (slope 1, parallel).\n- C: $8y = 10x + 5 \\rightarrow y = 1.25x + 0.625$ (slope 1.25, intersecting).\n- D: $y = x - 1$ (same line)."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Set the equations equal: $18x + 25 = -14x - 7$. Add $14x$ and subtract 25: $32x = -32 \\rightarrow x = -1$. Substitute back: $y = 18(-1) + 25 = 7$. Solution: $(-1, 7)$."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The second equation is $3$ times the first ($9x+15y=24$), so they are the same line. Solve $3x+5y=8$ for $x$ in terms of $y$: $3x = 8 - 5y \\rightarrow x = -\\frac{5}{3}y + \\frac{8}{3}$. If we let $y=r$, then $x = -\\frac{5r}{3} + \\frac{8}{3}$. This matches point C."

      "options": ["Student Grid-In"],
      "answer": "-19",
      "explanation": "Subtract the second equation from the first: $(mx + ky) - (2x + ky) = -83 - 22$. This simplifies to $(m-2)x = -105$. Since the intersection is at $x=5$, substitute $x=5$: $5(m-2) = -105$. Divide by 5: $m-2 = -21$. Add 2: $m = -19$."

      "options": ["A) 3", "B) 8", "C) 12", "D) 15"],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Cost of printers: $2 \\times 300 = 600$. Remaining budget: $1000 - 600 = 400$. Number of cartridges: $400 / 50 = 8$."

      "options": ["Student Grid-In"],
      "answer": "6",
      "explanation": "For infinite solutions, the equations must be proportional. Comparing $y$ terms ($y$ vs $3y$), the second equation is 3 times the first. Therefore, the $x$ coefficient must also be 3 times the first: $a = 3(2) = 6$."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "First, find $x$: $2x = -4 \\rightarrow x = -2$. Substitute into second eq: $-4 + y = -2 \\rightarrow y = 2$. The question text is obscured, but if the answer is -6 (Option A), it likely asked for something like $3x$ ($3(-2)=-6$) or $x-2y$ ($-2-4=-6$)."

      "explanation": "From eq 2: $x = 3y$. Substitute into eq 1: $3(3y) + y = 12 \\rightarrow 10y = 12 \\rightarrow y = 1.2$. Then $x = 3(1.2) = 3.6$."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Simplify given eq: $x - 4y = 2$ or $y = 0.25x - 0.5$. For no solution, lines must be parallel (same slope 0.25, different intercept).\n- C: $0.5x - 2y = 0 \\rightarrow 2y = 0.5x \\rightarrow y = 0.25x$. Slope matches, intercept (0) differs from (-0.5). Parallel."

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Set equal: $-x/9 = x/7$. This implies $x=0$. Then $y=0$. The value of $4(0)+0$ is $0$."

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Check D: First eq is $-2x+8y=5$ (or $2x-8y=-5$). Second eq is $4x-16y=10$ (divide by 2 to get $2x-8y=5$). The system requires $2x-8y$ to be both $5$ and $-5$, which is impossible."

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Divide eq 2 by 5: $x+4y=0$. Divide eq 3 by 3: $x+4y=11.33$. The equations demand $x+4y$ to be -16, 0, and 11.33 simultaneously, which is impossible. These are distinct parallel lines."
