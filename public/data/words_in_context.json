The narrator describes practicing the piano when she was a child.\nFor the talent show, I was to play a piece called \"Pleading Child\" from Schumann's Scenes from Childhood. It was a simple, moody piece that sounded more difficult than it was. I was supposed to memorize the whole thing, playing the repeat parts twice to make the piece sound longer. But I dawdled over it, playing a few bars and then cheating, looking up to see what notes followed. I never really listened to what I was playing. I daydreamed about being somewhere else, about being someone else.",

The text describes the narrator's friend Pheus, a young musician, after finishing a performance during a church service.\nPheus pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and wipes his forehead.
