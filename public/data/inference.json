This characterization can be useful, but it also presents drawbacks in terms of how the work is perceived, as it may lead readers to believe that Bronte merely fictionalized true events, which, in an artistic field where creativity and inventiveness are prized, can suggest that.",

One of these species, M. klissingiana, is found only in the state of Tamaulipas.

Some stayed buried for many centuries, such as the Parc-y-Meirch hoard, which was unearthed around 1868, and the Fittleworth hoard, discovered in 1995.
