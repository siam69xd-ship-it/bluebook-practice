As with most longitudinal studies, extensive funding support is needed for SAGE to collect the relevant data over timescales and at intervals that will support robust conclusions. But the quality of a more constrained investigation, such as a sociology study seeking only to yield the average age at which people in a given city first become parents, is much less dependent on high levels of funding because ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) such studies are likely to be a lower priority for funding than SAGE.", "B) the sociology study is unlikely to be able to recruit 66,000 participants.", "C) expanding the scope of such studies is unlikely to be feasible.", "D) such studies are not trying to identify trends over time."]}, "solution": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "The text contrasts the funding needs of longitudinal studies like SAGE, which require long-term data collection to identify trends, with more constrained studies that do not aim to track changes over time."}},
    {"id": "INF_002", "difficulty": "Medium", "content": {"passage": "Anne Bronte's 1847 novel Agnes Grey contains elements drawn from Bronte's own life: there are many parallels between the experiences of the novel's tide character and those of Bronte, and as a result Agnes Grey is regularly described as an autobiographical novel. This characterization can be useful, but it also presents drawbacks in terms of how the work is perceived, as it may lead readers to believe that Bronte merely fictionalized true events, which, in an artistic field where creativity and inventiveness are prized, can suggest that.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) Agnes Grey is less of an imaginative achievement than it actually is.", "B) the real-world counterparts of other characters in Agnes Grey are hard to identify.", "C) Bronte should not have claimed that Agnes Grey is based on real events.", "D) critics disagree about whether Agnes Grey shows greater originality than works without autobiographical elements."]}, "solution": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "The text discusses how labeling the novel as autobiographical might undervalue its creative aspects."}},
    {"id": "INF_003", "difficulty": "Medium", "content": {"passage": "Previous research has shown that plant species with a narrow geographical range tend to be more genetically homogeneous than plant species with extensive ranges are. Based on these findings, researchers recently ran simulations to predict how the genetic variation of several species of Mammillaria, a genus of cactus found throughout the Americas, might change in different distribution conditions. One of these species, M. klissingiana, is found only in the state of Tamaulipas. The researchers simulated what would happen if M. klissingiana spread to new habitats outside Tamaulipas, and, consistent with previous findings, the results showed that.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) several other Mammillaria species could survive in Tamaulipas in the future.", "B) the genetic homogeneity of M. klissingiana decreased over time.", "C) there was a gradual increase in the genetic homogeneity of Mammillaria species in states neighboring Tamaulipas.", "D) Mammillaria species other than M. klissingiana would become more common in Tamaulipas."]}, "solution": {"answer": "B", "explanation": "Expanding the range would increase genetic variation, decreasing homogeneity."}},

Bavin found a positive association between levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury in bodies of fresh water. Many other studies have yielded similar results, suggesting to some scientists that this association is true for all bodies of fresh water. But much of that research has been conducted at broadly similar sites in North America, and when Seam Noh and colleagues examined bodies of fresh water in South Korea, they found a negative association between dissolved organic carbon levels and mercury levels. If similar findings emerge from other locations outside North America, that could suggest that", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) the mercury levels reported in Noh and colleagues study were much higher than those reported in the study by Berndt and Bavin even though the dissolved organic carbon levels reported in the two studies were approximately the same.", "B) Berndt and Bavin may have inadvertently measured a different characteristic of bodies of fresh water than their levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury.", "C) the relationship between dissolved organic carbon and mercury reported by Berndt and Bavin reflects conditions that are characteristic of certain kinds of ecosystems in North America rather than universal conditions.", "D) most of the studies conducted in North America have measured dissolved organic carbon and mercury levels at a higher level of precision than was the case in Noh and colleagues study."]}, "solution": {"answer": "C", "explanation": "The association may be region-specific rather than universal."}},
    {"id": "INF_007", "difficulty": "Medium", "content": {"passage": "The British Bronze Age began when sophisticated techniques for making tools, weapons, and other objects from metal were introduced to the British Isles around 2500 BCE, and it lasted until around 700 BCE. In Britain during this time, collections of valuable metal objects (called hoards) were sometimes buried for safekeeping. Some stayed buried for many centuries, such as the Parc-y-Meirch hoard, which was unearthed around 1868, and the Fittleworth hoard, discovered in 1995. And although the period is known as the Bronze Age, some hoards, like the Fittleworth hoard, contained decorative objects made of gold; gold was much rarer than bronze, however, and thus it is not surprising that.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) some hoards contained no gold, as was the case for the Parc-y-Meirch hoard.", "B) most Bronze Age gold objects were melted down so that the gold could be reused.", "C) the skills needed to make tools and weapons from bronze were to adapt to making decorative items from gold.", "D) some hoards were found as a result of artifacts being dug up by accident."]}, "solution": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "Gold's rarity explains why some hoards lacked it."}},

Many other states draw similar distinctions between invasive and native species. But researchers Alejandro Camacho and Jason McLachlan have pointed out that Earth's climate is changing in ways that challenge such designations. Climate changes may cause animals to leave their current ranges and establish new ones. Climate changes may also create good habitats in areas where a species couldn't live previously. These observations suggest that.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) It's useful at present for North Dakota to distinguish between invasive and native species in some instances but not in the case of the spiny water flea.", "B) North Dakota was previously home to some spiny water flea but they were outcompeted by invasive species.", "C) state such as North Dakota may need to reevaluate their classifications of species.", "D) North Dakota should coordinate with other states to protect their native species from invasive species."]}, "solution": {"answer": "C", "explanation": "Climate change may require reevaluating species classifications."}},
    {"id": "INF_009", "difficulty": "Medium", "content": {"passage": "In June of 1987, South Korean liberalized its stock market, meaning that it began allowing foreign individuals and businesses to invest money in South Korean companies. This was part of a wave of stock markets liberalization from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s—Brazil in 1988, Venezuela in 1900, and so on. In an analysis of economic data from 1976 to 1993, Ross Levine and Sara Zervos found that liberalization did not lead to enduring increases in investment in companies based in countries that liberalized. Peter Blair Henry, however, found that, on average, investment in companies in liberalized countries increased significantly in the three years following liberation. Taken together, these results suggest that.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) investment growth is likely to be more consistent in countries that liberalize than in countries that do not.", "B) it typically takes at least three years for companies to benefit from government policies allowing foreign investment, but governments rarely maintain such policies for that long.", "C) economist's expectations about the effect of liberalization on investment were largely correct.", "D) companies based in countries that begin allowing foreign investment will probably see short term increases in investment, but that their gains are unlikely to last."]}, "solution": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "Short-term increases but no enduring ones."}},
    {"id": "INF_010", "difficulty": "Medium", "content": {"passage": "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from around 2500 BCE to approximately 700 BCE. Collections of metal items (called hoards) from all periods of the Bronze Age have been found in Britain, including the Llanarmon-yn-ĭāl hoard of artifacts from the 16th century BCE, unearthed around 1982, and the much later Horsehope Craig hoard of artifacts from the 7th century BCE, unearthed around 1865. Sometime in the Middle Bronze Age (approximately from the 14th century BCE to the 10th century BCE), metalsmiths in Britain began to develop swords for the first time. This fact helps explain why, whereas evidence of sword production was found in ______", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) both the Llanarmon-yn-ĭāl hoard and the Horsehope Craig hoard, only the latter included evidence of more refined sword production.", "B) hoards discovered before 1865, no such evidence was found in hoards that were discovered later.", "C) the Llanarmon-yn-ĭāl hoard, no intact swords were found among the items in the hoard.", "D) the Horsehope Craig hoard, no such evidence was found in the Llanarmon-yn-ĭāl hoard."]}, "solution": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "The earlier hoard predates sword development."}},

Bravo and colleagues found a negative association between levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury in bodies of fresh water. It may seem reasonable to be skeptical of this finding, since most other studies, such as research conducted in 2014 in Canada by Claire J. Oswald and Brian A. Branfireun, have found that dissolved organic carbon and mercury levels rise together. Like the latter study, however, most studies of the topic have been conducted in North America, and many of those study sites have similar characteristics to one another, suggesting that ______", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) Bravo and colleagues study may have inadvertently measured a different characteristic of bodies of fresh water than their levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury.", "B) few of the studies conducted in North America have been able to measure dissolved organic carbon and mercury levels with the same level of precision as in Bravo and colleagues' study.", "C) the mercury levels reported in Bravo and colleagues study were much higher than those reported in the study by Oswald and Branfireun even though the dissolved organic carbon levels reported in the two studies were approximately the same.", "D) Bravo and colleagues finding may differ from the findings of other studies due to a difference in environmental circumstances that affects the relationship between dissolved organic carbon and mercury in fresh water."]}, "solution": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "Environmental differences may explain varying associations."}},

    {"id": "INF_014", "difficulty": "Medium", "content": {"passage": "The small white heron and the little blue heron are long legged birds that live in wetlands, like the Everglades in Florida. Laura D'Acunto and colleagues wanted to know how these birds choose an area in which to live. They looked at features of these birds' habitats, such as how quickly water drains from the area and the amount of tree-canopy cover there is in the area. They found that small white herons prefer areas with extensive canopy cover, but this was not true for little blue herons. The researchers therefore concluded that wetland-management strategies that increase the amount of tree canopy in potential wetland bird habitats are less likely to ______.", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) attract little blue herons to the area than they are to attract small white herons to the area.", "B) extend the average lifespan of small white herons already in the area than they are to attract a greater number of those birds to the area.", "C) decrease the area's appeal to both small white herons and little blue herons than they are to increase the appeal to other species.", "D) attract birds that don't typically live in wetlands to the area than they are to attract small white herons or little blue herons to the area."]}, "solution": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "Preference differences affect management outcomes."}},

The traditional single-species approach to conservation emphasizes the need to focus on individual species most at risk, like M. guerreroois, but recently, conservationists have argued that an ecosystem-based approach that incorporates the many interactions between the climate, terrain, and various species of a given geographical area may lead to better outcomes for all the species in a given location. If this view is correct, the single-species approach to the conservation of M. guerreroois could thus______", "question": "Which choice most logically completes the text?", "options": ["A) lead to a better understanding of how the distribution of Mammillaria species throughout Mexico has affected their survival.", "B) allow conservationists to better consider how climatic changes affecting Guerrero may reduce the number of species competing with M. guerreroois.", "C) erroneously shift the focus of conservation efforts away from M. guerreroois itself.", "D) fail to consider the ways in which the survival of M. guerreroois may be influenced by changes in the populations of other species that inhabit Guerrero."]}, "solution": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "Ecosystem interactions are overlooked in single-species focus."}},
