(Indeed, the inhabitants may have deliberately buried the fox.) In addition, while wild foxes have a diet entirely made of meat, isotopic signatures of the skeleton’s teeth indicated that the fox’s diet, like that of the humans, was partly composed of plant material.

Barber et al. recorded the responses of moths from 252 genera, representing most families of large-bodied moths, to audio playback of bat echolocation. The researchers found that 52 of the genera, including several genera belonging to the geometer family, produced defensive ultrasonic clicks. This result suggests that ______",
