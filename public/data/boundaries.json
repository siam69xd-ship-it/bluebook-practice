      "solution": {
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The sentence requires a semicolon to connect two independent clauses ('The Great Salt Desert... is an arid desert' and 'it is one of the largest deserts...'). The phrase 'for example' is an introductory element that should be set off with a comma. Therefore, 'desert, for example;' is correct, using a comma before the introductory phrase and a semicolon to connect the clauses."

      },
      "solution": {
        "answer": "B",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The word 'however' is used here as a conjunctive adverb to show contrast between two independent clauses. When 'however' joins two independent clauses, it should be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma. However, looking at the choices, the correct structure is to treat 'however' as the end of the first clause, requiring a period. 'However. All' correctly uses a period to separate the two sentences, with 'All' starting the new independent clause."
