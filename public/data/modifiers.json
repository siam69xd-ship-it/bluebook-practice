            "question": "Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) was a mathematician and physicist who not only observed but also sought to explain the celestial dance above. Observing that the planets move in elliptical paths around the sun, ________\n\nWhich choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English?\nA) Kepler’s first law (the law of ellipses) was formulated in 1609.\nB) 1609 was when Kepler formulated his first law (the law of ellipses).\nC) Kepler formulated his first law (the law of ellipses).\nD) a formulation came to Kepler that resulted in his first law (the law of ellipses).",
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "This is a dangling modifier question. The introductory phrase 'Observing that the planets move in elliptical paths around the sun' must logically modify the subject that follows, which should be Kepler. Only C correctly places 'Kepler' as the subject performing the observation. A and B incorrectly make the law or year the subject, and D makes 'a formulation' the subject, which doesn't make sense."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This tests modifier agreement and pronoun reference. The modifier needs to describe Christopher John Boye, who is singular ('he'), not plural ('they' in A). C lacks a clear subject connection, and D is vague. B correctly uses 'he' and includes the comma for the introductory clause."
