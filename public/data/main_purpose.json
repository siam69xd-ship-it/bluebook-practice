        "passage": "When people think of dinosaurs with feathers, they typically think of winged dinosaurs, such as the bat-like Ambopteryx. However, many dinosaurs that didn't have wings also had feathers on their bodies. For instance, research indicates that the wingless large Yutyrannus likely had feathers.",
