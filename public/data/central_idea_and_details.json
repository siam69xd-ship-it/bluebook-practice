Like the rest of the books in the series, The Far Side of the World has a rather abrupt ending, but the following book, The Reverse of the Medal, picks up neatly where The Far Side of the World leaves off. Thus, the sudden ending is only an issue if one considers the books as independent texts—the Aubrey/Maturin series is best thought of as a single incredibly long work, similar to other multivolume stories, such as John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga.",

The team studied how cuttlefish wearing 3D glasses reacted to 3D images of shrimp (a favorite prey) projected on a tank wall.

Researchers hypothesize that this difference between the two feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone in their throats called the hyoid. Black-footed cats, which are much smaller than leopards, have a rigid hyoid that rumbles when the cat's larynx vibrates, resulting in a purr. By contrast, leopards have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that black-footed cats lack.

Researchers hypothesize that this difference between the two feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone in their throats called the hyoid. Flat-headed cats, which are much smaller than jaguars, have a rigid hyoid that rumbles when the cat's larynx vibrates, resulting in a purr. By contrast, jaguars have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that flat-headed cats lack. These traits allow jaguars and most other species of big cats to produce powerful roars. The same traits may also prevent most big cats from purring.",

          "passage": "The following text is adapted from Rupa Bajwa's 2004 novel The Sari Shop. Ramchand works as an assistant in a shop in Amritsar, India. Even at ten in the morning, the bazaar was throbbing with activity. The halwai [baker] was already installed in front of the Mishthaan Sweet Shop, pressing jalebi batter into squiggly shapes that floated and simmered in the oil in a big iron cauldron. All the shops had opened for the day and, Ramchand noted guiltily, all the shop assistants were already in place, trying to sell things with fixed, attentive smiles on their shiny, bathed faces.",
          "question": "Based on the text, what can most reasonably be inferred about Ramchand?",
          "options": [
            "A) Ramchand is remorseful about arriving to work later than other shop assistants he sees.",
            "B) Ramchand is mesmerized by frying jalebi batter while walking to work as a shop assistant.",
            "C) Ramchand is overwhelmed by a bazaar after seeing the chaos of other shop assistants selling goods.",
            "D) Ramchand is happy about being at work after seeing shop assistants who are satisfied with their jobs."

          "passage": "Economist Gabriel Zucman finds that 8% of worldwide household wealth is held in tax havens (territories such as Singapore with low tax rates for investors who reside outside those territories). Zucman also finds that use of tax havens differs between countries—they are rarely used by investors living in Japan, while many investors who utilize tax havens reside in Saudi Arabia or Greece. Philosopher Ingrid Robeyns disapproves of the use of tax havens as a method of tax avoidance that, though legally permissible, nonetheless helps investors to sidestep payment toward government upkeep.",
          "question": "Based on the text, what does Zucman's research suggest about investors residing in Japan?",
          "options": [
            "A) They are engaging in investment practices that Robeyns would acknowledge as beneficial because they are legally permissible.",
            "B) They are less likely than investors residing in Saudi Arabia to store wealth in Singapore.",
            "C) They are more likely than residents of Singapore to utilize investment strategies that might yield greater returns but that might also result in greater losses.",

          "passage": "Radamés Cordero et al. have confirmed that twenty mushroom species (including Coprinellus micaceus and species from the genus Russula) maintain subambient temperatures in both their fruited bodies and their mycelium (the root-like hyphae from which the fruited bodies grow), though the benefits of this hypothermic behavior are unclear. Noting that relative coldness was more pronounced in fruiting than in nonfruiting sites of the mycelium—a difference that persisted even after fruited bodies were detached—the researchers speculate that thermoregulation in the mycelium may influence reproductive success.",
          "question": "Which statement about the mycelium of the twenty mushroom species is best supported by the text?",
          "options": [
            "A) Variation in thermoregulation across the mycelium may occur independent of the presence or absence of fruited bodies.",
            "B) The correlation between higher mycelium temperature and greater fruit productivity indicates that successful reproduction may be dependent on thermoregulation in the mycelium.",
            "C) Temperatures in the fruiting areas of the mycelium are lower than in the nonfruiting areas due to differences in the depth and spread of the mycelium within soil or other organic matter.",
            "D) The mycelium generally maintains temperatures lower than those of the fruited bodies even when considering temperature variations between fruiting and nonfruiting sites."

          "answer": "A",
          "explanation": "The text says the temperature difference persisted even after fruited bodies were detached, indicating independence."

          "passage": "High-reward flowers that produce nectar with relatively high sugar concentrations are thought to be especially attractive to stripe-throated hermits and other hummingbird species. But when María A. Maglianesi and team monitored hummingbird visits to flowering plants, including Palicourea tomentosa, at Los Cusingos Bird Sanctuary and other sites in Costa Rica, they found that visit frequencies weren't influenced by nectar traits. Rather, physical compatibility of flower corollas (collections of petals) and hummingbird bills more strongly predicted hummingbird-plant interaction patterns.",
          "question": "Which statement about hummingbird preferences is most strongly supported by the text?",
          "options": [
            "A) Hummingbirds consistently prefer plant species whose flowers have physical traits that are compatible with their bills but offer relatively low nectar rewards.",
            "B) The floral traits that most strongly influence which plant species hummingbirds prefer may result in certain hummingbird species visiting flowers with relatively low nectar rewards over those with higher nectar rewards.",
            "C) Hummingbirds' preferences are primarily driven by trait-matching between their bills and flower corollas, though nectar qualities are a secondary factor driving their preferences.",
            "D) Physical compatibility between flower corollas and hummingbird bills becomes an important factor that influences hummingbird preferences when hummingbirds are uncertain about which plants produce highreward nectar."
          ],
          "answer": "B",
          "explanation": "The study found that physical compatibility, not nectar traits, predicted visits, so hummingbirds might visit flowers with lower nectar rewards if they are physically compatible."

          "passage": "Researchers who examined data from radio-tagged southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) identified fitness benefits gained by otters that used tools. By using fixed stones as anvils, tool-using otters gained access to high-quality, hard-shelled prey (e.g., mussels and clams) that they could usually not access through biting alone. Non-tool-using otters foraged abundant, energy-poor, easily extractable prey instead (e.g., snails). Even when easily processed prey were depleted, tool-using otters that processed mussels and clams were thus able to obtain their needed energy resources and to do so without incurring tooth damage.",
          "question": "What does the text most strongly suggest about southern sea otters in environments where snails, mussels, and clams are present?",
          "options": [
            "A) Those otters whose diet consists mainly of snails will likely exhibit less tooth damage than will those otters that use tools to consume mussels and clams.",
            "B) Those otters that do not use tools will likely have more robust health than those otters that do use tools.",
            "C) Those otters that do not use tools will likely need to process larger amounts of prey to meet their energy requirements than will those otters that use tools.",
            "D) Those otters that consume mussels and clams without the use of tools will likely spend less time foraging than will those otters that use tools to access the same prey resources."
          ],
          "answer": "C",
          "explanation": "Non-tool-using otters eat energy-poor prey (snails), so they need to eat more to meet energy needs compared to tool-using otters eating energy-rich prey."
