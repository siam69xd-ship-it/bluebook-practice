        "passage": "Dinosaurs, with the exception of the ancestors of birds, disappeared during a mass extinction 65 million years ago when an asteroid struck the Earth. Because a high metabolic rate has generally been suggested as one of the key advantages when it comes to surviving mass extinctions, some genetic palaeontologists have proposed that birds survived while non-avian dinosaurs did not because of the birds' increased metabolic capacity.",
        "question": "Which finding, if true, would undermine the genetic paleontologists' proposal?",
        "options": [
          "A) The metabolisms of non-avian dinosaurs may have decreased over time.",
          "B) Because some non-avian dinosaurs moved quickly, they likely had high metabolic rates.",
          "C) Birds have some of the highest metabolism rates of any creatures on Earth.",

Option B weakens this by suggesting that non-avian dinosaurs *also* likely had high metabolic rates. If both groups had high metabolisms but only one survived, then metabolic rate cannot be the sole deciding factor for survival."

The team found that the infants' heart rates and pupil size both decreased more during the lullaby than during the non-lullaby. Since a decrease in heart rate is associated with relaxation, the team concluded that the lullaby relaxed the infants. However, noting that reduced heart rate can also be associated with increased attention, one critic argues that instead, the lullaby simply attracted the infants' attention.",

          "C) A. aquaticus has been shown to accumulate several other types of manufactured nanoparticles in addition to WC-NPs, whereas P. perezi has been shown to accumulate only WC-NPs.",
          "D) When A. aquaticus and P. perezi are exposed to similar levels of WC-NPs, concentrations of WC-NPs in animals of both species show little variation from individual to individual."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The hypothesis proposes using A. aquaticus as a *proxy* (substitute) for P. perezi in safety testing. For a proxy to be valid, it should reflect the harm caused to the target species. Option A states that A. aquaticus accumulates the substance with *significantly fewer negative effects* than the frog. If the invertebrate remains healthy while the frog is harmed, testing the invertebrate would falsely suggest the substance is safe, making it a poor proxy."
